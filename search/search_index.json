From January to July of last year, Kyle Shores (ACOM) and Ward Fisher (Unidata) asynchronously dedicated a portion of their time working on projects across organizations. Kyle spent three months contributing cmake and modern build &amp; test infrastructure expertise to the netCDF project at Unidata, after which Ward reciprocated with 3 three months of expertise in structured software engineering and cross-platform software development to the Musica project at ACOM.
