We encourage you to share your experiences and hope to leverage this information to improve the experience for both mentors and mentees. We also strongly encourage our summer interns to participate and give feedback!</p> <p>Some potential discussion topics include:</p> <ul> <li>Do you participate in mentoring personally or as a team? Are you   participating in summer internship programs explicitly or working with   students in other ways (i.e. part-time students during the academic year)?   Are you only mentoring students or other staff members or groups?</li> <li>How can we foster a welcoming environment for our mentees where they feel   comfortable asking questions and making suggestions? How do you give and   receive constructive and actionable criticism?</li> <li>What are some challenges and successes in onboarding mentees with the   learning curve of research software engineering? (e.g., HPC, code specific   knowledge)</li> <li>Can you share some experiences and practices worth emulating, or ideas worth   trying?</li> <li>What is the best way for you to convey the intent and purpose of a project to   your mentee? What is the best way for a mentee to convey their progress to   you?</li> <li>What are some challenges and successes of mentoring remotely?</li> </ul> <p>Hope to see you there! For NCAR/UCAR Staff, add this event  to your calendar.
