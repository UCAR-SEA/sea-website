The UCAR Software Engineering Assembly (SEA) exists to serve the interests of the software engineering community at UCAR and NCAR.
All members are encouraged to interact with the SE community at UCAR, participate in communities of practice, attend our yearly
Improving Scientific Software (ISS) conference, share tips and techniques, and engage in respectful and constructive discussion.

Anyone who is interested in software engineering activities at UCAR is welcome to join the SEA (including external collaborators).
For those members who are SE staff at UCAR and NCAR, the SEA is also a vehicle to provide input to and drive dialog with senior management.
As membership is not limited to a single lab or facility, the SEA is uniquely positioned to provide a holistic view of the perspective
of SEs across the institution and the common challenges we face.
