The annual Improving Scientific Software Conference brings together software
engineers, scientists, developers - any individuals with an interest in
scientific software design - to share novel experiences and best practices,
develop connections across divisions and institutions, and advance our
community.

The scientific software ecosystem is experiencing changes unlike any in
recent times. Large language models are revolutionizing the software design
process, but understanding how to use them effectively and ethically remains a
major difficulty. Software support is more uncertain than ever, given the
disruptions we've seen to previously reliable funding streams, necessitating
more collaboration between public and private sectors than ever before. As
always, these challenges bring with them corresponding opportunities, and in
pursuing such opportunities, we can seek to *maintain the joy of software
development*.

### Audience

The conference is for staff and students at research institutions, universities,
and in industry who are interested in learning and discussing the latest
developments and practices in scientific software. Those working in the
geosciences will likely find it most relevant.  However, anyone who finds the
agenda beneficial to them is welcome to attend, even if they do not fit the
category previously stated.

### Sponsors

The 2026 Improving Scientific Software Conference is organized by the UCAR
Software Engineering Assembly (SEA) and funded by UCAR and NSF NCAR.

If your organization would like to sponsor the 2026 ISS Conference,
please reach out to the [ISS committee](mailto:iss_committee@ucar.edu) to
discuss funding opportunities and the associated benefits to your organization.

## Registration and Logistics

We expect registration to open in early 2026. Stay tuned for details.

This year, the Improving Scientific Software Conference will be held at NSF
NCAR's historic [Mesa
Laboratory](https://www.archives.ucar.edu/exhibits/mesalab), which is nestled
above the town of Boulder near the majestic Flatirons.

## Submitting an Abstract

!!! info "Submission Types"
    === "Talks"
        Talks will be allocated 20 minutes, with 15 minutes for the talk itself
        and 5 minutes for questions.
    === "Tutorials"
        Tutorials will be allocated between 1-4 hours; we will balance the
        request of the submitters along with the available of time in the
        program.
    === "Panels"
        Panels will be 1 hour. It is expected that panel submitters will
        identify and collaborate with 2-4 panelists.

We welcome any abstracts related to improvements in scientific software,
particularly those focused on the following topics:

- Use of AI in software design
- Collaborative efforts spanning groups within institutions
- Writing code that is easy for new contributors to understand
- Better practices for writing and maintaining documentation
- Effective approaches to prioritize and enhance community software maintenance
- Strategies for demonstrating legacy software value in a changing landscape
- What can software engineers, research software engineers, and scientists learn
  from each other?

We also strongly encourage abstracts from student and early-career participants
who might be interested.

### Student Submission Support

Registration, travel, and lodging support will be available for a select number
of accepted student submissions. Any undergraduate or graduate student
submitting any type of abstract is eligible for registration support. However,
**travel and lodging support are limited to U.S. students only.** During review,
abstracts will be categorized into one of three outcomes:

* Accepted with registration and travel support
* Accepted without travel support
* Not accepted

If a student submission is accepted without travel support, the submitter is
still encouraged to attend in-person if possible or virtually. If you have any
questions about student submission assistance, please reach out to the
[conference committee by email](mailto:iss_committee@ucar.edu).

### Proceedings

We will accept traditional paper submissions this year for publication alongside
a new option to upload slides and supporting materials such as computational
notebooks (with or without a corresponding paper) to a conference collection on
Zenodo.  Paper submissions will be due April 24th, 2026 and will undergo a
subsequent review process. Slides and computational notebooks should be
submitted to Zenodo by the end of the conference.

If you have any questions, please email the [ISS Proceedings
committee](mailto:iss_proceedings@ucar.edu). We plan to host office hours during
the conference if you have questions before the submission deadline.

project hosted or managed by UCAR, no matter what role they play or their
background.
