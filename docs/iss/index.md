# The Improving Scientific Software Conference

Since 2012, the Software Engineering Assembly has conducted a yearly conference
highlighting novel approaches to scientific software design, maintenance, and
use. In 2019, the conference was renamed the Improving Scientific Software
Conference to provide a unique identity related to, but distinct from, the SEA.

The ISS Conference welcomes attendees from all institutions including NSF NCAR/UCAR,
other National Labs, universities, and the private sector. If you would like to
help organize and plan the Conference, consider volunteering for our Planning
Committee - simply [send us an email](mailto:iss_committee@ucar.edu).

We hope to see you at the next ISS Conference in Boulder, CO!
