The annual Improving Scientific Software Conference brings together software
engineers, scientists, developers - any individuals with an interest in
scientific software design - to share novel experiences and best practices,
develop connections across divisions and institutions, and advance our
community.

The pace of change for those using and developing scientific software
accelerated in ways we have not seen in some time. Increasingly, tools and even
models from the private sector are crossing over into our science domains. Large
hyperscalers are driving changes in hardware priorities and we must adapt. And
generative AI developments invite both potential and uncertainty for both
developers and scientists.

The 2025 Improving Scientific Software Conference is organized by the UCAR
Software Engineering Assembly (SEA).

### Audience

The conference is for staff and students at research institutions, universities,
and in industry who are interested in learning and discussing the latest
developments and practices in scientific software. Those working in the
geosciences will likely find it most relevant.  However, anyone who finds the
agenda beneficial to them is welcome to attend even if they do not fit the
category previously stated.

## Submitting an Abstract

!!! info "Submission Types"
    === "Talks"
        Talks will be allocated 20 minutes, with 15 minutes for the talk itself
        and 5 minutes for questions.
    === "Tutorials"
        Tutorials will be allocated between 1-4 hours; we will balance the
        request of the submitters along with the available of time in the
        program.
    === "Panels"
        Panels will be 1 hour. It is expected that panel submitters will
        identify and collaborate with 2-4 panelists.

We welcome any abstracts related to improvements in scientific software,
particularly those focused on the following topics:

- Staying up to date with modern trends in RSE
- AI/ML, including its use in software development
- Community and legacy software development and modernization
- Improving the accessibility and usability of code bases to reach larger
  audiences (documentation, Jupyter notebooks, etc.)
- Scientific data analysis or visualization software
- Software development for HPC, accelerators, or any other non-standard hardware
  architectures
- Software management, both technical (e.g. CI/CD) and personnel-oriented (e.g.
  managing a team of developers)
- Continuously updating code bases to keep up with evolving background science;
  how innovations in science drive software development

We also strongly encourage abstracts from student and early-career participants
who might be interested.

### Proceedings

The ISS 2025 Conference will be using Jupyter Notebooks for proceedings again
this year. For those who are unfamiliar, Jupyter Notebooks allow for both static
representation of text, code, and equations using Markdown and HTML as well as
interactive execution of commands with a selected language kernel (interpretor).
This format provides authors with more tools to present their work and allows
readers the opportunity to interact with your code or science in ways not
possible with traditional text-only proceedings.

**Useful resources for authors:**

- Instructions for creating an ISS notebook proceeding  
- Example notebook proceedings

We expect authors to submit proceedings by the end of the Conference week (11
April, 2025). This timing will allow us to offer an office hour during the
conference to provide assistance to authors who want it.

If you have any questions, please email the [ISS Proceedings
committee](mailto:iss_proceedings@ucar.edu).
