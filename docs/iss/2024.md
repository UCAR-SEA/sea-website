## About ISS

The 2024 Improving Scientific Software Conference was held April 15-18, 2024 in Boulder, Colorado.
We also offered a virtual registration option for those interested in remote attendance.

### Audience

The conference is for staff and students at research institutions, universities, and industry who
are interested in learning and discussing the latest developments and practices in scientific
software. Those working in the geosciences will likely find it more relevant. However, anyone who
finds the agenda beneficial to them is welcome to attend even if they do not fit the category
previously stated.

This year’s conference focused on the modernization of scientific software and what that means to
our community now and in the years to come. We will touch on the challenges and opportunities of
modernizing software code, workflows, development, and more.

* Modernizing scientific code in large and small projects
    * Porting codes to new architectures (e.g., accelerators, Arm CPUs…)
    * Utilizing machine learning
* Modernizing software development practices
    * Adopting continuous integration and/or development in existing projects
    * Using code review during development
* Building communities around scientific software
    * Democratizing software development
* Improving scientific workflows
    * Incorporating containers into science workflows

### Proceedings

We have also adopted Jupyter Notebooks as paper proceedings for those interested in submitting.
Notebooks seamlessly combine descriptions of work and process, supporting graphics, and relevant
code into a self-contained and (optimally) rerunnable package.
