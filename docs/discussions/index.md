# SEA Open Discussion Series

Beginning in 2023, the SEA has held regular (roughly every 1-2 months) open
discussion events. Each event focuses on a particular topic of interest to the
SEA community, with the goal of sharing knowledge, creating collaborations,
breaking down silos, and building a community of practice.

These events are typically moderated by two individuals from the community.
Moderators need not be Committee members - anyone can volunteer! If you would
like to host an Open Discussion event for your particular topic of interest,
please reach out to the [SEA Steering
Committee](mailto:sea_committee@ucar.edu?subject=Interest in leading an SEA Open Discussion).

## Next Discussion

**Subject: Strategic Plans and navigating big picture themes**  
**Time: 14 November 2024 at 9 AM Mountain Time**

Recently, NSF NCAR staff were invited to provide feedback on the first draft of
the 2025-2029 NSF NCAR Strategic Plan (if you are staff, see [this Sundog
link](https://sundog.ucar.edu/page/8842) for more information and the draft
itself). Initial feedback from staff is due at the end of November, and so the
SEA is holding this impromptu discussion for two primary purposes: (a) provide a
venue for research software engineers within our organization to discuss the
draft document and (b) to discuss strategic planning in general. In addition to
specific feedback the SEA can pass forward to management, weâ€™d encourage you to
bring your thoughts on:

 - What do you focus on when reviewing or drafting a strategic plan?
 - Do you feel represented in strategic plans? If not, how could that be
   improved?
 - Do you see the impact of strategic plans on your work and/or environment?

This event is primarily intended for NSF NCAR/UCAR Staff. To join, [add this
event to your calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/event?action=TEMPLATE&tmeid=cWxpcXExdW41c2FrM3R1bm05Y2ZoODQwaGcgdmFuZGVyd2JAdWNhci5lZHU&tmsrc=vanderwb%40ucar.edu).
