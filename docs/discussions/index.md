# SEA Open Discussion Series

Beginning in 2023, the SEA has held regular (roughly every 1-2 months) open
discussion events. Each event focuses on a particular topic of interest to the
SEA community, with the goal of sharing knowledge, creating collaborations,
breaking down silos, and building a community of practice.

These events are typically moderated by two individuals from the community.
Moderators need not be Committee members - anyone can volunteer! If you would
like to host an Open Discussion event for your particular topic of interest,
please reach out to the [SEA Steering
Committee](mailto:sea_committee@ucar.edu?subject=Interest in leading an SEA Open Discussion).

## Next Discussion

**Subject: Mentorship**  
**Time: 6 June 2024 at 1 PM Mountain Time**

Any discussion topics are welcome, as are all experience levels. We encourage
you to share your experiences and hope to leverage this information to improve
the experience for both mentors and mentees. We also strongly encourage our
summer interns to participate and give feedback!

Some potential discussion topics include:

* Do you participate in mentoring personally or as a team? Are you
  participating in summer internship programs explicitly or working with
  students in other ways (i.e. part-time students during the academic year)?
  Are you only mentoring students or other staff members or groups?
* How can we foster a welcoming environment for our mentees where they feel
  comfortable asking questions and making suggestions? How do you give and
  receive constructive and actionable criticism?
* What are some challenges and successes in onboarding mentees with the
  learning curve of research software engineering? (e.g., HPC, code specific
  knowledge)
* Can you share some experiences and practices worth emulating, or ideas worth
  trying?
* What is the best way for you to convey the intent and purpose of a project to
  your mentee? What is the best way for a mentee to convey their progress to
  you?
* What are some challenges and successes of mentoring remotely?

Hope to see you there!
