# SEA Open Discussion Series

Beginning in 2023, the SEA has held regular (roughly every 1-2 months) open
discussion events. Each event focuses on a particular topic of interest to the
SEA community, with the goal of sharing knowledge, creating collaborations,
breaking down silos, and building a community of practice.

These events are typically moderated by two individuals from the community.
Moderators need not be Committee members - anyone can volunteer! If you would
like to host an Open Discussion event for your particular topic of interest,
please reach out to the [SEA Steering
Committee](mailto:sea_committee@ucar.edu?subject=Interest in leading an SEA Open Discussion).

## Next Discussion

**Subject: GPUs and other Accelerators**  
**Time: 13 August 2024 at 11 AM Mountain Time**

Join the UCAR Software Engineering Assembly for a lightly-moderated discussion
on the use of GPUs or any other hardware accelerators across UCAR.

Any discussion topics are welcome, as are all experience levels. We encourage
you to share your experiences, good and bad.

Some potential discussion topics include:  

* Current uses of GPUs and accelerators, including applications, discovered
benefits, and methods of implementation (CUDA, OpenACC, etc.).
* Barriers, challenges, or pitfalls to using GPUs.
* Thoughts on UCAR/NCAR pursuing GPU or accelerator capabilities versus other
  software-related goals or facilities. 
* What could SEA do to help support and/or advocate for community needs in this area?  

Hope to see you there! For NCAR/UCAR Staff, add [this
