# SEA Open Discussion Series

Beginning in 2023, the SEA has held regular (roughly every 1-2 months) open
discussion events. Each event focuses on a particular topic of interest to the
SEA community, with the goal of sharing knowledge, creating collaborations,
breaking down silos, and building a community of practice.

These events are typically moderated by two individuals from the community.
Moderators need not be Committee members - anyone can volunteer! If you would
like to host an Open Discussion event for your particular topic of interest,
please reach out to the [SEA Steering
Committee](mailto:sea_committee@ucar.edu?subject=Interest in leading an SEA Open Discussion).

## Next Discussion

**Subject: Developer Exchange Programs**  
**Time: 10 October 2024 at 2 PM Mountain Time**

Join the UCAR Software Engineering Assembly (SEA) at 2pm on October 10th for a
short presentation on developer exchange programs followed by a
lightly-moderated discussion.

Inspired by the 'visiting scientist' concept, ACOM and Unidata piloted a
Developer Exchange Program. From January to July of last year, Kyle Shores
(ACOM) and Ward Fisher (Unidata) asynchronously dedicated a portion of their
time working on projects across organizations. Kyle spent three months
contributing cmake and modern build & test infrastructure expertise to the
netCDF project at Unidata, after which Ward reciprocated with 3 three months of
expertise in structured software engineering and cross-platform software
development to the Musica project at ACOM.  Kyle and Ward's work focused on how
their skill sets could benefit the other's projects. With the successful
completion of this pilot program, we want to gauge interest in expanding this
program so that any software developer can participate.

If you wish to join us for this event and you are NCAR/UCAR Staff, add [this
