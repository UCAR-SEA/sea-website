# Welcome to the new SEA website

The UCAR Software Engineering Committee is excited to officially launch the new
SEA public facing website today! This long-awaited update will make it easier
for the SEA to provide timely updates and content to you, our community. Expect
additional content to be added the coming months.

In the meantime, please check out our archives of recent Improving Scientific
Software Conferences, Open Discussions, and links to our community portals. We
also have an archive of our old site available, so the content provided there is
still available.

If you have an interest in helping us with website content, feel free to submit
a pull request - this website uses a modified mkdocs template and pages are
tracked via the GitHub repository linked in the upper right.
