# Upcoming SEA Open Discussion on GPUs and Accelerators

Join the UCAR Software Engineering Assembly at 11 AM MT on Tuesday, August 13
for a lightly-moderated discussion on the use of GPUs or any other hardware
accelerators across UCAR.

Any discussion topics are welcome, as are all experience levels. We encourage
you to share your experiences, good and bad.

Some potential discussion topics include:  

* Current uses of GPUs and accelerators, including applications, discovered
benefits, and methods of implementation (CUDA, OpenACC, etc.).
* Barriers, challenges, or pitfalls to using GPUs.
* Thoughts on UCAR/NCAR pursuing GPU or accelerator capabilities versus other
  software-related goals or facilities. 
* What could SEA do to help support and/or advocate for community needs in this area?  

Hope to see you there! For NCAR/UCAR Staff, add [this
