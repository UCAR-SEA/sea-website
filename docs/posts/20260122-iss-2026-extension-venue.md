# ISS 2026 Abstract Deadline is Now January 30th

The deadline is fast approaching to submit abstracts to the 2026 [Improving
Scientific Software Conference](iss). The ISS Conference will be held April
6-10, 2026 in Boulder, CO with the theme of *Maintaining the Joy of Software
Development*.

To give submitters a bit of extra time, we are extending the abstract submission
deadline by one week to Friday January 30th, 2026 at 5 PM MT. We welcome anyone
with an interest in improving scientific software design, quality, development,
deployment, and support to submit an abstract for a talk, tutorial session, or
panel. Student travel and registration support is available and submitters can
also choose to participate in a conference proceeding.

We have also decided to move ISS 2026 from the previously announced NSF NCAR
Mesa Lab location to our traditional home at the Center Green Campus. Due to
facilities construction timeline changes, this venue is once again available to
us and offers easier logistics for conference attendees. The conference will be
hybrid, so virtual presentations are also welcome.

You may submit an abstract [here](iss/2026/#submitting-an-abstract) and visit
our [conference website](iss/2026) for more information.
