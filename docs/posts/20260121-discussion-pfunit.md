# Upcoming SEA Tutorial and Discussion: Fortran Unit Testing and pFUnit

Join the UCAR Software Engineering Assembly (SEA) at 2 pm on February 12th for a
tutorial and open discussion on unit testing Fortran code with
**[pFUnit](https://github.com/Goddard-Fortran-Ecosystem/pFUnit)**, a Fortran
testing framework developed by NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center for testing
high-performance Fortran libraries. In this session, NSF NCAR software engineer
Andy Stokely will highlight how pFUnit simplifies the process of writing tests
and lowers the barrier to adopting thorough testing practices in Fortran
codebases. The session will begin with a tutorial demonstrating how pFUnit can
be used to develop a Fortran library using Test-Driven Development (TDD).

Following the tutorial, the discussion will expand to examine the role of unit
testing in scientific and high-performance Fortran development, including how
testing can improve code quality, support long-term maintainability, and enable
safer refactoring as requirements evolve. The conversation will also focus on
how testing can facilitate more effective collaboration between software
engineers and scientists. Participants are encouraged to share experiences,
challenges, and perspectives related to adopting testing practices in scientific
software projects.

Discussion topics will include:

* Applying Test-Driven Development to Fortran libraries
* Using unit tests to define expected behavior and verify correctness
* How testing supports maintainability and safe refactoring
* Ways unit testing can improve collaboration between scientists and software
  engineers

All are welcome, regardless of prior experience with pFUnit or unit testing. If
you are UCAR/NCAR staff, please use [this
