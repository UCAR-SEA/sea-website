# Participate in an upcoming SEA event on language interoperability

The UCAR SEA is planning to have a discussion, with a few short presentations,
on the topic of language interoperability, providing an opportunity for groups
to share their experiences and plans in this area. This can include more
traditional Fortran-C/C++ interoperability, but we're especially interested in
interoperability with other languages such as Python and Julia.

For example, the Earth System Modeling Framework (ESMF) team is considering
building out capabilities to facilitate the coupling of model components written
in Python or Julia with those in Fortran, C and C++.

We are looking for volunteers to give microtalks on the subject. Do you have
experience with this kind of language interoperability that you would be willing
to share in a short (~ 5-minute) presentation or through participation in a
discussion session on this topic – sharing successful techniques, challenges
you’ve encountered, etc.? Or does your group have plans to add capabilities in
this area that you would be willing to share?

If so, please contact [Brian](mailto:vanderwb@ucar.edu) to discuss how you can
get involved.
