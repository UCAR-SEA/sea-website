# Presenting the ISS 2025 Conference Proceedings

The 2025 Improving Scientific Software Proceedings Committee is excited to
present the cumulative efforts of the many authors who wrote and submitted a
paper to our Conference Proceedings - which are now accessible via the [ISS 2025
Proceedings Gallery](iss/2025-proceedings).

This year, we decided to experiment with using Jupyter Notebooks as the paper
format instead of plain-text papers, allowing for greater expressiveness and the
potential for interactivity in papers. This decision required additional work on
behalf of both the submitters and the editorial team; we thank both for their
efforts and enthusiasm which have helped to make this process a success.

The ISS Conference Committee is in the initial planning stages for the 2026
Conference. Stay tuned for additional details later this year.
