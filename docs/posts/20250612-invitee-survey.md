# Help provide ideas for future SEA events

The UCAR SEA would like your input on desired presenters and/or topics of
interest for our event calendar for the rest of the 2025 calendar year. We have
funds for FY2025 that we can use to invite (domestic) speakers, so we encourage
you to be aspirational in your suggestions. We are open to any type of relevant
event you'd like to suggest, but some examples include:

* One-hour invited seminar talks
* 1+ hour tutorials
* Multi-day workshops

The SEA Committee will coordinate the logistics of funding the invited presented
and advertising the event, and we can also organize times to meet with the
presenter if that is of interest.

To submit your input, please fill out this brief
[3-question survey](https://forms.gle/xsNUCSZp1vBVFDfH6). Thank you!
