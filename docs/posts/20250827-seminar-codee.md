# SEA Seminar: Code Review and Testing with Codee

The UCAR Software Engineering Assembly is hosting a virtual seminar and
demonstration of the Codee code review and testing platform at **9 AM MT on
Wednesday, September 24th**. We will welcome developers from Codee, who will
demonstrate the platform and answer any questions you have. Codee is intended to
simplify and accelerate code review and testing for Fortran/C/C++ code. The
platform finds opportunities to secure, correct, modernize, port and optimize
software, enforcing coding guidelines, streamlining integration, and ensuring
portability. For more information on Codee, see [this
brochure](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KM7luHs4722bb-EI62nJ9duG3BB9Jj_Z/view?usp=drive_link).

The developers intend to demonstrate Codee using a relevant Weather and Climate
code. Please reach out to [Brian Vanderwende](mailto:vanderwb@ucar.edu) **by
September 2nd** if you would like to provide your code base for the
demonstration. Doing so would also give you a direct opportunity to see how
Codee might apply to your code development workflow.
