# Reminder: Improving Scientific Software Conference Accepting Abstracts

The [2026 Improving Scientific Software Conference](iss/2026) is accepting
abstracts through January 23, 2026. The conference is planned for April 6-10,
2026 at NSF NCAR's Mesa Laboratory in Boulder, CO with the theme being
*Maintaining the Joy of Software Development*. We are [accepting abstract
submissions](iss/2026/#submitting-an-abstract) for talks, tutorials, and panel
sessions, and presenters may attend either in person or virtually.

You have likely seen news coverage last week that the National Science
Foundation (NSF) is planning a review of NSF NCAR's research and observational
capabilities. The ISS Conference organizers have no additional details on the
exact timing or scope of the review. We understand that this news may raise
questions or concerns about any potential impacts on the conference. At this
time, we do not expect any disruption and plan to continue with the conference
as intended. **We encourage all interested in participating to proceed with
submissions**. We will keep you updated if anything changes.
