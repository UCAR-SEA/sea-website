# ISS 2025 Slides, Recordings, and Post-Conference Survey

The [2025 Improving Scientific Software
Conference](https://sea.ucar.edu/iss/2025/) Committee would like to thank all
presenters and attendees for making this year's Conference a success. We were
happy to see valuable contributions from many different institutions and areas
of study, as well as good discussion during the networking events and socials.
If you registered for the conference, you should have received a post-conference
survey. This survey will remain open until 10 May 2025, should you wish to
provide us with feedback.

We have also posted the slides and recordings from each presentation and
tutorial on the [Online Conference
Program](https://sea.ucar.edu/iss/2025-program/). These materials are available
to all.
