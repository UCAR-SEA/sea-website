# ISS 2026 Block-rate Lodging Now Available

A quick addendum to yesterday's announcement - we are now able to offer our
block-rate lodging for the [2026 Improving Scientific Software
Conference](iss/2026).

As in prior years, the walking-distance [Residence Inn
Boulder](https://www.marriott.com/en-us/hotels/vbocg-residence-inn-boulder/overview/?scid=f2ae0541-1279-4f24-b197-a979c79310b0)
is our partner hotel. The block rate is $109 per night and is available from
Sunday, April 5 through Saturday, April 11, so you can extend your stay beyond
the end of the conference (Thursday, April 9) if you wish to spend time
exploring Boulder. The last day to book using the block rate is  **Sunday, March
8, 2026!**

See our [conference website](iss/2026) for a link to the booking portal.
