# 2026 Improving Scientific Software Conference now accepting abstracts

The UCAR Software Engineering Assembly's [Improving Scientific Software
Conference](iss/) is returning in 2026! Next year's ISS will take place April
6-10, 2026 at NSF NCAR's Mesa Laboratory in Boulder, CO. The theme of the
conference will be:

> *Maintaining the Joy of Software Development.*

We are now accepting abstract submissions for talks, tutorials, and panel
sessions. As always, we welcome anyone with an interest in improving scientific
software design, quality, development, deployment, and support. **Abstracts are
due by: Friday January 23, 2026.** We plan to provide student support as funding
allows and will accept paper submissions for a conference proceeding.

You may submit an abstract [here](iss/2026/#submitting-an-abstract) and visit
our [conference website](iss/2026) for more information.
