Registration for in-person attendance has now closed for this year's ISS
Conference. Thank you to all who have signed up to join us in Boulder next
month; we look forward to seeing you! If you have not yet registered but would
still like to attend, *virtual* registration will remain open until the end of
the day on April 3rd.

information about registration and our [virtual conference
program](https://sea.ucar.edu/iss/2025-program/) for a listing of all planned
talks, tutorials, and events.
