# Upcoming SEA Discussion: Strategic Plans and navigating big picture themes

Join the UCAR Software Engineering Assembly (SEA) at 9:00 am MT on November 14th
for a lightly-moderated discussion on Strategic Plans and navigating big picture
themes.

Recently, NSF NCAR staff were invited to provide feedback on the first draft of
the 2025-2029 NSF NCAR Strategic Plan (if you are staff, see [this Sundog
link](https://sundog.ucar.edu/page/8842) for more information and the draft
itself). Initial feedback from staff is due at the end of November, and so the
SEA is holding this impromptu discussion for two primary purposes: (a) provide a
venue for research software engineers within our organization to discuss the
draft document and (b) to discuss strategic planning in general. In addition to
specific feedback the SEA can pass forward to management, weâ€™d encourage you to
bring your thoughts on:

 - What do you focus on when reviewing or drafting a strategic plan?
 - Do you feel represented in strategic plans? If not, how could that be
   improved?
 - Do you see the impact of strategic plans on your work and/or environment?

This event is primarily intended for NSF NCAR/UCAR Staff. To join, [add this
event to your calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/event?action=TEMPLATE&tmeid=cWxpcXExdW41c2FrM3R1bm05Y2ZoODQwaGcgdmFuZGVyd2JAdWNhci5lZHU&tmsrc=vanderwb%40ucar.edu).
