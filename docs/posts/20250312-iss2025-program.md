# ISS 2025: Program and registration are available now

The [online program](iss/2025-program/) is now available for the 2025 Improving
Scientific Software Conference. Our 4-day program includes a number of talks and
two tutorials, along with two keynote presentations (details to be announced
soon). We would like to thank all who submitted an abstract to this year's
event!

Remember that registration is open now for the conference, which will take place
April 7-10, 2025 in Boulder, CO and virtually. In-person registration closes on
Friday, March 21, so make sure you register soon if you plan to join us in
Boulder. Virtual registration will close on April 3. We have also extended the
reduced-rate conference hotel booking deadline to March 19th. For more
information along with the link to the registration portal, visit the [ISS 2025
