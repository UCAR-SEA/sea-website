# Tutorial and Discussion Recording: Fortran Unit Testing and pFUnit

For those of you that could not make last week's Fortran Unit Testing tutorial
and discussion, we have posted a recording of the event to the [SEA Youtube
Channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOXG_T_T-d4). As always, [discussion
notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZqB4E1Zu7Gkv8_6VkLLpnAfrYbcOqw8d4XpWdKA7nJ0/edit?usp=sharing)
from the event have also been uploaded.

You can find links to all notes and recordings in our [Open Discussions
page](events/discussions). We're currently planning the next discussion for
early March - stay tuned for an announcement (topic hint: using LLMs in coding)!

As always, if you would like to suggest a Discussion topic, or volunteer to lead
a discussion, reach out to the [SEA Steering
Committee](mailto:sea_committee@ucar.edu).
