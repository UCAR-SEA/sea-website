# Upcoming SEA Seminar and Open Discussion on Developer Exchange Programs

Join the UCAR Software Engineering Assembly (SEA) at 2pm MT on October 10th for a
short presentation on developer exchange programs followed by a
lightly-moderated discussion.

Inspired by the 'visiting scientist' concept, ACOM and Unidata piloted a
Developer Exchange Program. From January to July of last year, Kyle Shores
(ACOM) and Ward Fisher (Unidata) asynchronously dedicated a portion of their
time working on projects across organizations. Kyle spent three months
contributing cmake and modern build & test infrastructure expertise to the
netCDF project at Unidata, after which Ward reciprocated with 3 three months of
expertise in structured software engineering and cross-platform software
development to the Musica project at ACOM.  Kyle and Ward's work focused on how
their skill sets could benefit the other's projects. With the successful
completion of this pilot program, we want to gauge interest in expanding this
program so that any software developer can participate.
