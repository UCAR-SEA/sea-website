# SEA Panel Discussion on Language Interoperability

The UCAR Software Engineering Assembly will hold a panel of lightning talks
followed by a discussion on language interoperability at 3 PM MT on Wednesday
February 26, 2025.

The discussion can include more traditional Fortran-C/C++ interoperability, but
we're especially interested in interoperability of compiled codes with
interpreted languages such as Python and Julia. For example, the Earth System
Modeling Framework (ESMF) team is considering building out capabilities to
facilitate the coupling of model components written in Python or Julia with
those in Fortran, C and C++.

We currently have the following panel speakers, who will present ~5 minute
lightning talks on related experiences and perspectives:

* **Bill Sacks** - thoughts on prospective ESMF capabilities to facilitate the
  coupling of model components written in Python and Julia with C/C++/Fortran
  code
* **Kyle Shores** - team maintains a lot of C++ code with C interface exposed
  for Fortran and Python interoperability
* **Orhan Eroglu** - GeoCAT experiences leveraging Python-Fortran (via f2py) and
  Python-C++  (via Cython) interoperability

There is still room for 1-2 more panelists, so please reach out to the [SEA
committee](mailto:sea_committee@ucar.edu) if you may be interested. If you are
NCAR/UCAR staff, you can use [this calendar
