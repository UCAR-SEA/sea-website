# Introducing the UCAR SEA Virtual Coworking Room

While we live in an age of working from home and hybrid offices, people still
often feel the need to work in a shared space with the opportunity for
spontaneous collaboration and camaraderie.

If you are an NSF NCAR/UCAR/UCP employee, we invite you to hop into the UCAR SEA
Virtual Coworking Room anytime. This room is a perpetually open Google Meet with
no set agenda. Feel free to join and work independently until you wish to chat
or simply drop by for a quick virtual watercooler conversation. This space is
yours to use in any way you find productive.

Meet link for NSF NCAR/UCAR/UCP staff: [UCAR SEA Virtual Coworking Room](https://meet.google.com/sut-hkmf-ieu).

*As for any collaborative space intended for employees, we expect all who make use of the
Coworking Room to abide by the [UCAR Code of
Conduct](https://www.ucar.edu/who-we-are/ethics-integrity/codes-conduct/everyone).*
