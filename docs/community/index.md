# Get Involved

If you want to become involved in the SEA, there are many ways to join our community:

1. Our primary communication platforms are our Slack workspace and mailing list.
2. You can also participate directly by joining our Steering Committee or our ISS Planning Committee.
3. If there is a specific topic you are passionate about, you can volunteer to lead an Open Discussion.

And of course, we are always open to new ideas for SEA activities.
