# Get Involved

If you want to become involved in the SEA, there are many ways to join our community:

1. Our primary communication platforms are our [Slack workspace](https://ucarsea.slack.com) (new users can sign up with [this invite link](https://join.slack.com/t/ucarsea/shared_invite/zt-3by28gvzo-3mZEGXB3giPLRllyGaDPZQ)) and [mailing list](listserv.md).
2. You can also participate directly by joining our [Steering Committee](../about/index.md#steering-committee) or our [ISS Planning Committee](../iss/index.md).
3. If there is a specific topic you are passionate about, you can volunteer to lead an [Open Discussion](../discussions/index.md).

And of course, we are always open to new ideas for SEA activities.

## UCAR SEA Virtual Coworking Room

While we live in an age of working from home and hybrid offices, people still
often feel the need to work in a shared space with the opportunity for
spontaneous collaboration and camaraderie.

If you are an NSF NCAR/UCAR/UCP employee, we invite you to hop into the UCAR SEA
Virtual Coworking Room anytime. This Google Meet is perpetually open with no set
agenda. Feel free to join, work independently until you wish to chat or simply
have a quick virtual watercooler conversation. This space is yours!

*As for any collaborative space intended for employees, we expect all who make use of the
Coworking Room to abide by the [UCAR Code of
Conduct](https://www.ucar.edu/who-we-are/ethics-integrity/codes-conduct/everyone).*
