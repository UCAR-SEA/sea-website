# Get Involved

If you want to become involved in the SEA, there are many ways to join our community:

1. Our primary communication platforms are our [Slack workspace](https://ucarsea.slack.com) (new users can sign up with [this invite link](https://join.slack.com/t/ucarsea/shared_invite/zt-3by28gvzo-3mZEGXB3giPLRllyGaDPZQ)) and [mailing list](listserv.md).
2. You can also participate directly by joining our [Steering Committee](../about/index.md#steering-committee) or our [ISS Planning Committee](../iss/index.md).
3. If there is a specific topic you are passionate about, you can volunteer to lead an [Open Discussion](../discussions/index.md).

And of course, we are always open to new ideas for SEA activities.
