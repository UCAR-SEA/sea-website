# SEA Open Discussion Series

Beginning in 2023, the SEA has held regular (roughly every 1-2 months) open
discussion events. Each event focuses on a particular topic of interest to the
SEA community, with the goal of sharing knowledge, creating collaborations,
breaking down silos, and building a community of practice.

These events are typically moderated by two individuals from the community.
Moderators need not be Committee members - anyone can volunteer! If you would
like to host an Open Discussion event for your particular topic of interest,
please reach out to the [SEA Steering
Committee](mailto:sea_committee@ucar.edu?subject=Interest in leading an SEA Open Discussion).

## Latest Discussion

**Subject: Fortran Unit Testing and pFUnit**  
**Time: 12 February 2026 at 2 PM Mountain Time**  
**Presenter: Andy Stokely**

Join the UCAR Software Engineering Assembly (SEA) at 2 pm on February 12th for a
tutorial and open discussion on unit testing Fortran code with
**[pFUnit](https://github.com/Goddard-Fortran-Ecosystem/pFUnit)**, a Fortran
testing framework developed by NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center for testing
high-performance Fortran libraries. This session will highlight how pFUnit
simplifies the process of writing tests and lowers the barrier to adopting
thorough testing practices in Fortran codebases. The session will begin with a
tutorial demonstrating how pFUnit can be used to develop a Fortran library using
Test-Driven Development (TDD).

Following the tutorial, the discussion will expand to examine the role of unit
testing in scientific and high-performance Fortran development, including how
testing can improve code quality, support long-term maintainability, and enable
safer refactoring as requirements evolve. The conversation will also focus on
how testing can facilitate more effective collaboration between software
engineers and scientists. Participants are encouraged to share experiences,
challenges, and perspectives related to adopting testing practices in scientific
software projects.

Discussion topics will include:

* Applying Test-Driven Development to Fortran libraries
* Using unit tests to define expected behavior and verify correctness
* How testing supports maintainability and safe refactoring
* Ways unit testing can improve collaboration between scientists and software
  engineers

All are welcome, regardless of prior experience with pFUnit or unit testing. If
