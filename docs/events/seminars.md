# SEA Seminars

The UCAR SEA holds regular seminars during which we welcome speakers from
UCAR/NSF NCAR as well as external organizations to give presentations and demos
on topics of interest to the SEA community. These seminars are typically virtual
to ensure attendees from all sites have the same experience, but we can hold
in-person seminars in Boulder, CO as well if there is a clear benefit.

If you wish to give a seminar, or have a topic or speaker in mind and want us to
facilitate an event, reach out to the [SEA Steering
Committee](sea_committee@ucar.edu) with a description of your vision for the
seminar.

### 24 September, 2025 - Code Review and Testing with Codee

**Recording: [Youtube Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2EobfRWOi3Y)**

The UCAR Software Engineering Assembly hosted a virtual seminar and
demonstration of the Codee code review and testing platform at 9 AM MT on
Wednesday, September 24th. We welcomed developers from Codee, who demonstrated
the platform using basic examples and MPAS-A code.

Codee simplifies and accelerates code review and testing for Fortran(C/C++)
code. The platform finds opportunities to correct, modernize, port, secure and
optimize software, enforcing coding guidelines, streamlining integration, and
ensuring portability apart from also formatting from F77 to F2023 code.
