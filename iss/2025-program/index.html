Later, as a contractor at EMC, he helped lead the last two operational implementations of the NAM. He also worked on the Real Time and UnRestricted Mesoscale Analysis systems and oversaw six operational implementations. He became a federal employee at EMC in 2018 in the Data Assimilation and Quality Control Group and led the development of NOAA’s next generation, convection-allowing ensemble prediction system, the Rapid Refresh Forecast System.

Over the past couple of decades the production suite has become increasingly complex with the advancement of science and technology. The development and implementation methods of the past are no longer suitable for the level of complexity of today’s systems. We now find ourselves with increasingly risky, high-stakes, big bang implementations that are susceptible to costly delays.</p> <p>An alternative approach is one that features more frequent, smaller upgrades underpinned by a robust foundation of proven agile methodologies, such as CI/CD and unit testing of the substantial repository of scientific software.

Prior to joining NCAR he was postdoctoral research fellow at NASA Ames Research Center. While at NASA he designed and developed a task based dynamic runtime scheduling system to interface with NASA multi-physics high performance computing (HPC) applications. He received his PhD in mechanical engineering from Stanford University in 2021 where his dissertation focused on writing performance portable multi-physics solvers for heterogeneous HPC systems. His current research interests are at the intersection of computational physics and HPC</em></p> <p>The current state-of-the-practice for Single-Program, Multiple-Data (SPMD) applications utilizes a bulk-synchronous paradigm (BSP) implemented with non-blocking Message Passing Interface (MPI) communication calls. In this paradigm, the order of execution of the computational kernels is hard coded at compile time in order to overlap communication and computation in a synchronized fashion. In simple applications this approach is relatively easy to implement and can provide sufficient parallel scalability. However, it is difficult to specify a performant schedule at compile time for applications that simultaneously run multiple interdependent algorithms on a diverse set of data structures. This presentation covers a library that we have developed, Task Graph Scheduler (TGS), to solve this problem by dynamically scheduling computational kernels at runtime using directed acyclic graphs to track the data dependencies between kernels. This system was specifically designed to leverage existing computational infrastructure as much as possible, supporting the extension of legacy applications. TGS has been incorporated into the eddy high-order multi-physics solver developed at NASA. Details regarding the implementation, our experiences using this system, and performance will be discussed.</p> <p>*This research was supported by an appointment to the NASA Postdoctoral Program at the NASA Ames Research Center, administered by Oak Ridge Associated Universities under contract with NASA.

A few workload managers are common in traditional scientific HPC (e.g., Slurm and PBS) with newer tools like Kubernetes also becoming more common. For better or worse, HPC users and administrators are often forced to adapt to a new scheduler upon procurement of the latest system, at which point they come to appreciate the strengths and limitations of the new tool.</p> <p>At NSF NCAR, our two main clusters - Derecho and Casper - both run PBS Pro, though we have used Slurm in the recent past as well. Compared to some of its competitors, PBS Pro's user interface has notable deficiencies: users cannot query historical jobs beyond a few days, administrators cannot query relative job execution priorities, and some queries impose a serious performance impact on the PBS server. To mitigate these weak points, we have developed a number of tools including a cached qstat (job query tool), qhist (a historical record tool), and pbs_prio (a priority query tool).</p> <p>In this talk, we introduce these tools for those unfamiliar, and also discuss recent efforts to modernize them. Such efforts include adding requested features, increasing robustness, incorporating more modern Python programming practices, improving documentation, converting scripts into actual Python packages, and adding regression testing. We will also describe how these improvements to our tools will inform future priorities as we continue to support our PBS Pro users. </p></details></div> </div> <div class=row> <div class=cell><b>12:00 PM</b></div> <div class=cell></div> <div class=cell-content><p></p> <details class="info cell"> <summary>Lunch</summary> <p></p></details></div> </div> <div class=row> <div class=cell><b>1:00 PM</b></div> <div class=cell>Agnieszka Żaba</div> <div class=cell-content><p></p> <details class="abstract cell"> <summary>Continuous Integration with research notebooks: on maintaining reproducibility in atmospheric modeling</summary> <p><strong>[<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Gf215UR210X6DQjqLQ-upcUAK-60idcf/view?usp=drive_link">Slides</a>] - [<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErMtewdCY4s&t=16375s">Recording</a>]</strong></p> <p><em>Agnieszka is a PhD student in the Environmental Physics Group (zfs.agh.edu.pl/en) at the Faculty of Physics and Applied Computer Science, AGH University of Krakow.

The integration of research notebooks with automated software testing workflows is an essential prerequisite for this. We present reusable tools and solutions engineered in the development and maintenance of the PySDM (open-atmos.github.io/PySDM) and PyMPDATA (open-atmos.github.io/PyMPDATA) atmospheric modeling projects. Both packages are developed entirely in Python, using just-in-time compilation tools (Numba &amp; NVRTC) to enable a single-language HPC tech stack that covers simulation, analysis, and visualization codes. We will discuss the perspectives of both user and developer on reproducibility.</p> <p>From the user's perspective, maintenance of notebooks that reproduce paper results using up-to-date project codebase serves the purpose of documenting and exemplifying project features and applications. It enables exploratory usage with little-to-no effort needed to set up a working environment. However, this is contingent on a design embracing modularity and inversion of control - it is not uncommon in atmospheric modeling for papers to use different simulation flow control or different parameterizations. We present the inversion of control solutions from PySDM that enable the choice of formulae and constants from user code, without trade-offs in: (i) performance, (ii) ability to switch between CPU and GPU backends, and (iii) dimensional analysis of physics-relevant routines for testing unit correctness. The maintenance of notebooks within code repositories also poses challenges in terms of handling embedded visuals. The jupyter-utils project (pypi.io/p/open-atmos-jupyter-utils) helps with embedding GitHub-renderable and Jupyter-book-compatible vector graphics and animations. </p> <p>From the developer's perspective, research notebooks within the code repository are a source of test scenarios and constraints for the assertions that constitute a robust regression-test suite. We present the notebook_vars() function from the jupyter-utils package, designed to be used in concert with the fixture logic of the pytest framework. It enables the execution of the notebook code once in a test session, allowing us of the final notebook state in multiple automated tests. This occurs without modifications to the notebooks themselves. In notebooks pertaining to specific research studies, a direct link from test code up to subject literature is provided. Overall, we achieve an improvement in code readability and refactoring capability.</p> <p>The presented solutions, along with the availability of platforms such as Google Colab, mybinder.org or institutional Jupyter hubs, ensure single-click reproducibility of research-paper results, and a structure for retaining this through future releases of the code base. In addition to the benefits for software users and developers, this satisfies the scientific-method and research-journal reproducibility requirements. </p></details></div> </div> <div class=row> <div class=cell><b>1:20 PM</b></div> <div class=cell>Brett Neuman</div> <div class=cell-content><p></p> <details class="abstract cell"> <summary>GitHub Actions Workflows using Self-Hosted Runners for HPC</summary> <p><strong>[<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wDHHwr8dQ4fvSxierxZ1wLhX7rqXKpOk/view?usp=drive_link">Slides</a>] - [<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErMtewdCY4s&t=17493s">Recording</a>]</strong></p> <p><em>Brett is a consultant for the Consulting Services Group (CSG) in the Computational and Information Systems Laboratory (CISL) at NCAR.

Upcoming missions are getting a new opportunity to explore these techniques from the ground-up. IMAP, a heliophysics mission launching in 2025, is able to develop an entire pipeline with a cloud-first attitude.

In the atmospheric sciences, this trade off has commonly resulted in computationally intensive codebases such as numerical weather prediction (NWP) and data assimilation being written partially or wholly in low-level languages (e.g., C, Fortran) for efficiency, which can be more difficult to actively develop and modify than higher-level languages. Julia is a relatively new language designed for scientific computing that combines a high-level and intuitive syntax similar to Python and Matlab with the inherent performance of lower-level languages in part through “just-in-time” compilation, making it natively as fast as C or Fortran in several benchmarks. Julia is based on a “multiple-dispatch” design philosophy that is well suited to many scientific applications. This talk will detail efforts being made at Colorado State University to implement performant and readable code using Julia across a wide variety of meteorological applications ranging from radar processing to idealized numerical weather prediction (NWP) experiments.</p> <p>Radar quality control (QC) involves removing non-meteorological echoes such as the earth’s surface or biological targets and is important for obtaining useful information from radar data. In the past, data was QCed by radar meteorologists parsing the data by hand or using relatively simple rules-based thresholding methods. Recently, a Machine Learning (ML) technique was created in Python that outperformed the existing methods. A new version of the automated removal algorithm, named RONIN.jl (Random-forest Optimized Nonmeteorological IdentificatioN) has been developed entirely in Julia that further increases the accuracy of the QC, while operating at speeds orders of magnitude quicker than the original Python code - highlighting the utility of Julia for ML applications. </p> <p>A NWP model aimed at investigating atmospheric dynamics, coined Scythe.jl, has also been created in Julia and will be presented. Scythe is based on the spectral transform method and uses a mixture of cubic B-spline, Fourier, and Chebyshev basis functions to represent physical variables and their spatial derivatives in a variety of coordinate systems, with multi-processing capabilities using both the Julia Distributed package and multi-threading.. The spectral gridding engine of Scythe.jl, dubbed Springsteel.jl, is also being utilized as the basis for a variational data analysis and assimilation tool called Daisho.jl. The combination of these Julia packages will ultimately provide an end-to-end analysis, assimilation, and simulation toolkit that interfaces seamlessly with the Lidar Radar Open Software Environment (LROSE) for next-generation processing of remote sensing data from the Airborne Phased Array Radar (APAR) for improved understanding and prediction of high-impact weather. </p></details></div> </div> <div class=row> <div class=cell><b>3:10 PM</b></div> <div class=cell>Jen DeHart</div> <div class=cell-content><p></p> <details class="abstract cell"> <summary>Improved Accessibility and Community Knowledge of Lidar and Radar Data Analysis</summary> <p><strong>[<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CxH_qufKStz3i8kkY9I5SCbYJ3Os2nK9/view?usp=drive_link">Slides</a>] - [<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErMtewdCY4s&t=23779s">Recording</a>]</strong></p> <p><strong>Coauthors: Ana Espinoza</strong></p> <p><em>Jen is a Research Scientist II at Colorado State University.

Utilizing the “Zero to JupyterHub with Kubernetes” workflow, the science gateway integrates LROSE with other lidar and radar meteorology software packages. This integration allows users to execute applications directly from the JupyterLab terminal, streamlining the creation of datasets for further analysis and visualization within Jupyter notebooks. By combining traditional command-line operations with modern Python-based tools for data analysis and visualization, this gateway provides a robust end-to-end solution that caters to both educational and research needs. The gateway has already facilitated LROSE instructional workshops and classroom exercises. Our work demonstrates the significant potential of merging established scientific computing techniques with advanced Python environments, opening new avenues for computational science education and research.</p> <p>The LROSE team has acquired successive allocations on the NSF Jetstream2 cloud at Indiana University through ACCESS. To develop the LROSE Science Gateway, we employed the “Zero to JupyterHub with Kubernetes” workflow ported to the NSF Jetstream2 cloud, enabling rapid and scalable deployment to accommodate a variable number of users. Authentication is managed through either GitHub OAuth or temporary credentials, depending on the situation. Since LROSE is a collection of C/C++ applications, we configured Docker containers based on the Jupyter Docker Stack to integrate the LROSE software, available via the JupyterLab terminal. These containers also include Conda package manager environments equipped with Python packages like Py-ART, CSU RadarTools, and Metpy for further data analysis. A shared drive accessible to all participants contains instructional datasets for lidar and radar data analysis.</p> <p>Tutorials take the form of Jupyter notebooks for use by individuals, in classroom exercises, or at instructional workshops. Some tutorials are complete with pre-loaded examples to quickly visualize workflows and results. Other tutorials guide students how to run the applications independently. All tutorials are hosted on the LROSE Science Gateway GitHub repository, which is open to contributions from colleagues and community members.</p> <p>Future plans include an "intermediate" level workshop on SAMURAI, one of the multi-Doppler wind applications of the LROSE suite. Additionally, work is currently underway to run GUI applications in the same browser-based JupyterLab environment. GUI applications for radar and lidar data visualization utilize the QT framework and present unique technical challenges. The techniques to accomplish GUI access have immediate applications for other GUI programs, such as NFS Unidata's IDV and their version of the AWIPS CAVE data visualization tools. Lastly, as demand for the resources found on the gateway increases, it becomes increasingly important to efficiently manage the Jetstream2 resources allocated by the ACCESS program. LROSE, NSF Unidata, San Diego Supercomputing Center (SDSC), and Indiana University staff are working together to deploy and evaluate Kubernetes cluster auto-scaling. With autoscaling, resources will no longer sit idle while awaiting new logins and will instead be provisioned on-demand. </p></details></div> </div> <div class=row> <div class=cell><b>3:30 PM</b></div> <div class=cell>Amit Ruhela</div> <div class=cell-content><p></p> <details class="abstract cell"> <summary>An introduction to TACC HPCPerfStats</summary> <p><strong>[<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jkuOaAC0HDLEUqGetKl-yL798205z97Q/view?usp=drive_link">Slides</a>] - [<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErMtewdCY4s&t=24978s">Recording</a>]</strong></p> <p><strong>Coauthors: John Cazes</strong></p> <p><em>Dr. Amit Ruhela works as a Manager in the HPC group at TACC, Austin.

One approach to accelerate development of such materials is to pull content from existing open source or creative commons tutorials, without starting from scratch. Another possible benefit of adapting existing tutorials, such as The Carpentries, is to incorporate the pedagogical expertise already embedded within these resources. Yet, while there is a wealth of existing tutorial content both in open source and in research computing, remixing and adapting tutorial content is surprisingly challenging. As the landscape of scientific computing evolves, the ability to efficiently repurpose and structure existing materials is critical to keeping pace with emerging technologies and best practices. Drawing from our experience developing a notebook-based, semester-long course for graduate researchers, we will discuss practical strategies for curriculum design, the adaptation of existing resources while also considering the broader social challenges of recruitment and time management. This talk explores how educators and research software engineers (RSEs) can effectively tailor existing materials to create structured, impactful learning experiences. </p> <p>The demand for RSEs continues to grow as scientific research becomes increasingly computational. Yet, RSEs come from diverse backgrounds including STEM, the social sciences and humanities, and computing, often acquiring essential software engineering skills informally or on the job. This hodgepodge of experience presents challenges not only for individuals looking to round out their interdisciplinary skill set but also for teams striving for maintainable, reproducible, and efficient software development in research-oriented settings. Recognizing this gap from our own RSE experiences at interdisciplinary labs, we set out to develop a semester-long curriculum designed to equip non-CS graduate students with the software engineering skills necessary for research environments. Our approach involved leveraging existing Software Carpentries modules and structuring them into a “Foundations of Research Software Engineering” lab course. Throughout this process, we encountered certain challenges in adapting these resources - how to effectively pull relevant parts of the lesson, how to make changes without losing pedagogical integrity, and how to balance core concepts with real-world applications. In this talk, we share our experience navigating tutorial adaptation and our takeaways from that experience, highlighting both the benefits and drawbacks of this process, as well as the social elements required to execute the human side of curriculum development such as recruiting students and time management in planning. We will also introduce the concept of Open Source Education (OSE) and review the legality of remixing open source or creative commons tutorials.</p> <p>These takeaways can be applied to other use cases where educators, researchers, and developers may feel overwhelmed by the vast amount of existing material and struggle to tailor it to their specific needs. </p></details></div> </div> <div class=row> <div class=cell><b>4:10 PM</b></div> <div class=cell></div> <div class=cell-content><p></p> <details class="success cell"> <summary>Notebook Proceedings Office Hours</summary> <p>During the Notebook Proceedings Office Hours, we will provide guidance on preparing and formatting Jupyter Notebook-based conference proceedings.

Using neural network ensembles to quantify uncertainty is competitive with approaches based on Bayesian neural networks while benefiting from better computational scalability. However, building ensembles of neural networks is a challenging task because, in addition to choosing the right neural architecture or hyperparameters for each member of the ensemble, there is an added cost of training each model. To address this issue, we propose AutoDEUQ, an automated approach for generating an ensemble of deep neural networks. Our approach leverages joint neural architecture and hyperparameter search to generate ensembles. This ensemble and the law of total variance can be used to decompose the predictive variance of deep ensembles into aleatoric (data) and epistemic (model) uncertainties.</p> <p>AutoDEUQ is built into DeepHyper, a scalable python-based library for automated neural architecture and hyperparameter search and can readily be deployed in serial and parallel platforms for deep ensembles based uncertainty quantification.

Traditional sensitivity analysis methods, such as the finite-difference method, the direct decoupled method (DDM), the complex variable method, and the adjoint method, have limitations. Some suffer from numerical errors when applied to nonlinear models (e.g., finite difference and complex step methods), while others (e.g., DDM and adjoint methods) require significant effort to maintain when the base model is updated.</p> <p>To address these challenges, we present CMAQ-hyd, an augmented version of the Community Multiscale Air Quality model (CMAQ), implementing the hyperdual-step method for computing numerically exact first- and second-order sensitivities of species concentrations with respect to emissions and initial conditions. Compared to CMAQ-DDM and CMAQ-adjoint, CMAQ-hyd is easier to update and maintain while remaining free of subtractive cancellation and truncation errors. Furthermore, it achieves these improvements while being computationally efficient, reducing the resource burden compared to traditional finite-difference methods for the same sensitivity calculations.</p> <p>We will also showcase the implementation of the hyperdual-step method in other potential applications using an automated file conversion process. This method can be seamlessly integrated into various models where accurate first- and second-order sensitivity calculations are essential for research and analysis. </p></details></div> </div> <div class=row> <div class=cell><b>11:00 AM</b></div> <div class=cell>Prentice Bisbal</div> <div class=cell-content><p></p> <details class="abstract cell"> <summary>The first step to making your code more accessible: Make it easier to build and install!</summary> <p><strong>[<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UXJjfc_DWsCCmmziLpDMzriyfWfX1jiO/view?usp=drive_link">Slides</a>] - [<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FwJNPHx86GY&t=9653s">Recording</a>]</strong></p> <p><em>Prentice Bisbal is an HPC Systems Engineer III in the Computational and Information Systems Lab (CISL) at NSF NCAR.

Major updates are often deprioritized due to the non-trivial effort required to complete them and in favor of competing demands for resources on new projects. There's also a hesitation to modify functioning systems, fearing disruptions to service. However, taking the time to modernize a system that continues to serve a valuable purpose has many benefits. Last year, the MAVEN Science Data Center (SDC) at the Laboratory for Atmospheric &amp; Space Physics (LASP) began efforts to bring its pipeline to current standards and best practices with the goal of creating an improved workflow that is easier to maintain.</p> <p>The MAVEN SDC hosts the data collected by the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution (MAVEN) mission, which explores the planet’s upper atmosphere, ionosphere, and interactions with the sun and solar wind. The SDC maintains a website where users can find instrument documentation, view quicklook plots, and access the data via RESTful APIs. Additionally, we also deliver data quarterly to NASA's Planetary Data Systems archives for long term stewardship. The underlying architecture and code that supports these responsibilities was created over a decade ago, resulting in a brittle codebase and system that are challenging to test and troubleshoot.</p> <p>Our team has improved our workflow by updating the running Python version, replacing a Postgres testing database with a serverless SQLite database, transitioning to open source, refactoring testing frameworks, leveraging GitHub features, and revamping documentation. Further improvement efforts will involve moving the internal storage archive from a deprecated AWS vault to high-performing s3 storage and containerizing the SDC with Docker. These updates have enhanced our CI/CD pipeline and enabled local testing for efficient feature development. The long-term goal is ensuring consistency with other mission SDCs managed by LASP and streamlining the onboarding of new maintainers. This initiative also offers an opportunity to assess new tools and best practices, paving the way for a more robust, accessible and maintainable system.

In TDD, tests of individual units of software (e.g., procedures) serve documentation and verification roles. As documentation, tests specify the behaviors required for code correctness. Executing a suite of tests verifies that the actual behaviors satisfy the documented requirements. As inspired by the Veggies and Garden unit testing frameworks for modern Fortran, the more lightweight Julienne framework uses the Template Method pattern to report serial or parallel test results in the form of a specification (<a href=https://go.lbl.gov/julienne>https://go.lbl.gov/julienne</a>). As such, Julienne’s test output names the test subject (e.g., a class or type-bound procedure), the expected behavior, the test outcome (pass or fail), and provides diagnostic information if a test fails.</p> <p>The use of Julienne centers around users defining a test in the form of a non-abstract child type that extends Julienne’s abstract test_t derived type. The user’s child type thus inherits an obligation to define type-bound procedures that name the subject of the test and provide the test results. As a template method, test_t’s type-bound “report” procedure invokes the user’s procedures by referencing the aforementioned deferred bindings and reporting on the collective success or failure across multiple images (processes) in programs that use Fortran’s multi-image parallel programming features.</p> <p>Working from the example test suite in the Julienne repository, attendees will learn how to write and run a simple test suite, including how to use Julienne’s string-handling for producing rich diagnostic information from a failing test. Attendees will also see examples of Julienne’s use in other Berkeley Lab software projects such as the Fiats deep learning library and Matcha T-cell motility simulator.</p> <p>Attendees will also learn a functional programming pattern developed and used by the Berkeley Lab Fortran presenters. Functional programming centers around the definition of pure procedures that are free of side effects, including file input and output. To supplement the material on external verification via unit tests, this tutorial will also introduce our Assert utility library and Assert’s use for runtime correctness-checking inside procedures (<a href=https://go.lbl.gov/assert>https://go.lbl.gov/assert</a>). Attendees will learn how Assert addresses a common reason developers cite for not writing pure procedures: a desire to produce diagnostic output when debugging code. We posit that most developers seek output to verify an expectation about data and that such expectations can be stated in assertions that take the form of logical expressions. Attendees will learn how Assert empowers developers to obtain rich, customized diagnostic information through character stop codes when an assertion fails, resulting in error termination. Attendees will also learn how to use Assert in such a way that guarantees zero runtime overhead by automatically eliminating assertions in production builds of user software. </p></details></div> </div> <div class=row> <div class=cell><b>2:30 PM</b></div> <div class=cell></div> <div class=cell-content><p></p> <details class="info cell"> <summary>Break</summary> <p></p></details></div> </div> <div class=row> <div class=cell><b>3:00 PM</b></div> <div class=cell>Guoqing Ge</div> <div class=cell-content><p></p> <details class="abstract cell"> <summary>Promoting open science: a better tool for version controlling mega binary data files - git-mega</summary> <p><strong>[<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1H9TRQHYoYpy4Fqtu_EvoWFjxjccBHX32/view?usp=drive_link">Slides</a>] - [<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FwJNPHx86GY&t=24511s">Recording</a>]</strong></p> <p><em>Dr. Ge is a research scientist at CIRES/NOAA GSL and works on improving the NOAA operational forecasts through the data assimilation developments.</em></p> <p>In recent years, the drive towards open science has been gaining momentum, with researchers recognizing the importance of transparent and accessible data sharing.

The focus of his work on implementing the PIEKTUK model for simulating the blowing snow events.</em></p> <p>The Automated Surface Observing System (ASOS) provides essential meteorological data for weather forecasting, climate studies, and atmospheric research. However, working with raw ASOS data presents significant challenges due to its large volume, inconsistent formatting, and the presence of duplicate or missing entries. Before meaningful analysis can be conducted, extensive preprocessing—cleaning, sorting, and organizing—is required. This manual process is not only time-consuming but also prone to errors, making it a major bottleneck in research workflows. To address this issue, we have developed a Python-based algorithm that automates the cleaning and sorting of ASOS data, significantly improving efficiency and accuracy. The algorithm reads raw ASOS files and processes them based on user-defined criteria, allowing flexible and efficient data organization. Specifically, it sorts data according to meteorological variables (e.g., temperature, mean sea-level pressure, visibility, gust, wind speed, wind direction), time, and station location. Additionally, it detects and removes duplicate entries, ensuring data integrity and consistency. The structured output is then saved in separate folders based on the chosen sorting criteria, providing an organized dataset ready for analysis. One of the key strengths of this tool is its adaptability to various research needs. Users can customize the sorting and filtering process to focus on specific parameters relevant to their study. Whether analyzing long-term climatological trends, investigating extreme weather events, or validating numerical weather prediction (NWP) models, researchers can quickly extract and organize the data they need without the burden of manual preprocessing. Furthermore, by automating these tedious tasks, the algorithm reduces human errors and enhances the reproducibility of research findings. The algorithm was designed with usability in mind, making it accessible to students and researchers with varying levels of programming experience. It requires minimal setup and provides clear output structures, making ASOS data more accessible to a broader scientific community. Additionally, its efficiency in handling large datasets ensures that researchers can process weeks or even months of ASOS observations in a fraction of the time required for manual data handling. This research will discuss the implementation details of the algorithm, including its structure, optimization strategies, and performance when processing large ASOS datasets. As scientific software development continues to evolve, automation will play a crucial role in improving data-driven decision-making. This contribution aims to foster discussions on best practices in scientific software development and encourage collaborations to further enhance meteorological data processing tools. </p></details></div> </div> <div class=row> <div class=cell><b>3:40 PM</b></div> <div class=cell>Samuel Akinjole</div> <div class=cell-content><p></p> <details class="abstract cell"> <summary>Development of GEOS-Chem-hyd: Enabling Calculation of Numerically Exact Second-Order Sensitivities</summary> <p><strong>[<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Tu3Q8bcrKMmGapRJ3YSxsu96khipSK96/view?usp=drive_link">Slides</a>] - [<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FwJNPHx86GY&t=26595s">Recording</a>]</strong></p> <p><em>Samuel Akinjole is a Ph.D. candidate in Environmental Engineering with a minor in Applied Data Science at Drexel University.

Fiats, an acronym that expands to “Functional inference and training for surrogates” or “Fortran inference and training for science,” is a deep learning utility that targets high-performance computing applications in Fortran 2023. The first application trains a cloud microphysics neural-network surrogate model that has been integrated into the Berkeley Lab fork of the Intermediate Complexity Atmospheric Research (ICAR) model (<a href=https://go.lbl.gov/icar>https://go.lbl.gov/icar</a>). The second application performs parallel inference with an aerosol dynamics surrogate pretrained using data from the Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM – <a href=https://e3sm.org/ >https://e3sm.org/</a>). </p> <p>Fiats provides novel support for functional programming styles by providing inference and training procedures declared to be “pure,” a language requirement for invoking a procedure inside Fortran’s loop-parallel construct: “do concurrent.” Because pure procedures clarify data dependencies, at least four compilers are currently capable of automatically parallelizing “do concurrent” on central processing units (CPUs) or graphics processing units (GPUs). The talk will present strong scaling results on a single node of Berkeley Lab’s Perlmutter supercomputer, showing near-ideal scaling up to 16 cores with additional speedup up to the hardware limit of 128 cores based on results obtained by compiling with a fork of the LLVM Flang Fortran compiler.</p> <p>Fiats provides a derived type that encapsulates neural-network parameters and provides generic bindings for invoking inference functions and training subroutines of various precisions. A novel feature of the Fiats design is that all procedures involved in inference and training are non-overridable, which eliminates the need for dynamic dispatch at call sites. In addition to simplifying the structure of the resulting executable program and potentially improving performance, we expect this feature to enable the automatic offload of inference and training to GPUs. </p> <p>The talk will conclude by presenting the use of “do concurrent” in a parallel training algorithm, highlighting the considerable simplifications afforded by the evolution of “do concurrent” from its introduction in Fortran 2008 to its enhancement in Fortran 2018 and further enhancement in Fortran 2023. </p></details></div> </div> <div class=row> <div class=cell><b>8:50 AM</b></div> <div class=cell>Daniel Abdi</div> <div class=cell-content><p></p> <details class="abstract cell"> <summary>Developing a Data-Driven Emulator for the High-Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR) Model</summary> <p><strong>[<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1t_X9_XdHPYQr0ezcnA_3MMjO13C2TEsa/view?usp=drive_link">Slides</a>] - [<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV1tyzzr0Ho&t=3331s">Recording</a>]</strong></p> <p><em>Daniel is a research scientist at CIRA currently working on developing data-driven models for medium-range weather forecasting for both global and regional applications.

To complement and enhance this process, our project focuses on developing a data-driven emulator for the HRRR model. Using state-of-the-art machine learning techniques, we aim to deliver computationally efficient alternatives that maintain or exceed the accuracy of traditional numerical models. This work leverages a large HRRR dataset, preprocessed into Zarr format with chunking optimized for efficient training and inference. </p> <p>Our approach explores two primary machine learning architectures: ResNet-based models (ResHRRR) and graph-based models (GraphHRRR). ResHRRR leverages convolutional neural networks and incorporates enhancements such as squeeze-and-excitation blocks and Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) to improve accuracy. GraphHRRR builds on previous work in global weather modeling, adapting it to rectangular CONUS domains with Delaunay triangulation and modified boundary handling. We first tested these models on subdomains (e.g., western U.S. and central U.S.) and achieved promising results in predicting key variables like wind speed and temperature. Notably, the GraphHRRR model outperformed ResHRRR in capturing high-resolution spatial details, particularly for composite reflectivity. Forecasts on the whole CONUS domain but at a reduced resolution of 6km instead of the native 3km resolution exhibited similar performance characteristics as the small subdomains.</p> <p>Initial results demonstrate the potential of these emulators in achieving fast and reliable forecasts with lead times up to 9 hours. Enhanced sharpness in predictions was achieved by integrating denoising diffusion models, which significantly improve the quality of forecasts for variables like reflectivity. Future work will optimize memory usage, and explore novel probabilistic methods such as GenCast and CorrDiff. By combining advanced data-driven approaches with traditional numerical weather prediction, this project aims to pave the way for more efficient and scalable operational forecasting systems. </p></details></div> </div> <div class=row> <div class=cell><b>9:10 AM</b></div> <div class=cell>David Hahn</div> <div class=cell-content><p></p> <details class="abstract cell"> <summary>µWMS: Cloud-Based Microservice Web Map Service</summary> <p><strong>[<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/14fWHTCeBl-X3aNqrwm68YCFyj_DE5g8K/view?usp=drive_link">Slides</a>] - [<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV1tyzzr0Ho&t=4394s">Recording</a>]</strong></p> <p><em>David Hahn is a software engineer at UCAR, primarily in NCAR/RAL, but also working for UCP/COSMIC and UCP/JCSDA over the years.

She is currently in her first semester of graduate school, studying Data Science. She began working with FABRIC in January 2024. Initially, she assisted in creating and updating teaching materials—experiments designed for professors to use in their classes to teach concepts in networking—maintained by FABRIC. Currently, she is working on the Jupyter Notebook Generation project presented in the abstract. Her research interests include Generative AI, data mining and data analysis.*</p> <p>Jupyter notebooks are now widely used by the research community to set up, launch, run, analyze, and document scientific experiments. Jupyter notebooks also allow scientific software and experiments to be easily shared by researchers and has resulted in extensive shared notebook repositories. The massive number of example notebooks available not only has made it easier for researchers to write notebooks, but also represents a wealth of data that can be used by Generative AI systems to automatically generate experiment-specific notebooks. This paper describes the use of RAG-based AI techniques to automatically generate jupyter notebooks in the context of the NSF FABRIC testbed.</p> <p>FABRIC is a next generation network testbed that consists of over 30 sites across the U.S., Asia, and Europe, including many supercomputing facilities and other specialized testbeds. Each FABRIC node (“router”) is an advanced compute cluster with GPUs, FPGAs, programmable NICs, and large amounts of storage. In this sense, FABRIC can be regarded as a federation of HPC-style resources that can be programmed – including the network. </p> <p>In order to program the FABRIC testbed, including reserving and managing resources, researchers must use FABlib, a python API. While there is an extensive collection of example JupyterHub notebooks and documentation demonstrating this usage, the learning curve for first-time users can be steep, a challenge often seen in other HPC environments. Moreover, as the capabilities and scope of FABRIC expands, finding the necessary information from notebook usage examples and combining different elements becomes increasingly more complex and difficult. To address this problem, we have implemented an AI-based tool, leveraging the power of LLMs and Retrieval Augmented Generation(RAG), that generates a draft Python notebook based on the user's request. Automating the routine steps that researchers would have to take when getting started with FABRIC, we can give them a chance to be more focused on their experiments. </p> <p>In our talk, we will present the architecture of the application, design decisions we have made, and the user-side experience. We will also discuss such details as the different LLM models tested, RAG techniques explored, prompt engineering, and finally, the challenges we have faced as we are continuing to improve its performance. Since RAG is a technique that is recently being adapted in various fields to try and create specialized chatbots, we hope this talk will be a helpful guide to the audience if they decide to take upon such a project in their own research area. </p></details></div> </div> <div class=row> <div class=cell><b>9:50 AM</b></div> <div class=cell></div> <div class=cell-content><p></p> <details class="info cell"> <summary>Break</summary> <p></p></details></div> </div> <div class=row> <div class=cell><b>10:20 AM</b></div> <div class=cell>Brad Klotz</div> <div class=cell-content><p></p> <details class="abstract cell"> <summary>An Interconnected Workflow Design for Simulating Airborne Phased Array Radar (APAR) Data</summary> <p><strong>[<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1re7YtS0C7ycmXW84qNwDY9zQZlDtaept/view?usp=drive_link">Slides</a>] - [<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV1tyzzr0Ho&t=8527s">Recording</a>]</strong></p> <p><em>Brad Klotz is a Project Scientist within the Remote Sensing Facility of NSF NCAR's Earth Observing Laboratory. During his four and a half years at NSF NCAR, Brad has worked primarily on the Airborne Phased Array Radar (APAR) program, supporting APAR simulation software development, data generation, algorithm development, and overall science team logistics and coordination. Throughout his career, Brad has devoted much of his time and energy on supporting airborne remote sensing, especially pertaining to severe weather and tropical weather systems.</em></p> <p>The Airborne Phased Array Radar (APAR) program is currently under development through support from NSF and NOAA. This transformational radar will become the first airborne, C-band, phased array weather radar for use within the scientific community. While the hardware and associated aircraft modifications are still in development, it is critical for scientists and engineers to have an understanding of the performance capabilities of the radar as it pertains to scanning, data collection and processing, and scientific applications. There are many available scientific applications for radar data, many of them held within the NSF NCAR supported Lidar Radar Open Software Environment (LROSE). Data quality control, 3-D wind analyses, and discrimination of particle types in LROSE are several examples of tools that are useful for APAR. These applications serve as an end goal for the utilization of the collected data.</p> <p>To provide research quality data in the current stage of APAR development, an APAR scientific simulator was developed. Known as the APAR Observing Simulation, Processing, and Research Environment (AOSPRE, pronounced “A-Osprey”), this tool is able to read in high-resolution numerical weather model data, such as from the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model, and compute radar moments in the context of the APAR scanning parameters and characteristics. This software environment is designed to serve as an interconnecting framework of existing software tools and modules in order to provide a seamless workflow of simulated radar data generation. Currently, AOSPRE is broken into three main software blocks, which includes a pre-processing phase, a radar simulation phase, and a data processing and applications phase. For this presentation, a detailed discussion of the design of each phase in the workflow will be provided. For the pre-processing phase, a user points to a database of high-resolution numerical model output and can design a relevant flight plan in and around the weather of interest. This flight planning tool has recently advanced to a GUI that allows either manual or machine-learning based guidance on the most ideal path. The GUI application was developed in Matlab but can be operated within a container. Information on the flightpath and desired scanning patterns are stored for use in a namelist file that is accessed in phase two of the workflow. The main portion of the AOSPRE codebase controls reading in the weather model output, operating the designated flight, generating the APAR output, and saving the output in CfRadial files. This code is currently written in Fortran and incorporates multiple subroutines and modules that handle different aspects of determining the aircraft location, scanning, and conversion from model to radar coordinates. It also uses an existing moment generator, called the Cloud-resolving Radar SIMulator (CR-SIM), for final computation of the radar moments. This portion of AOSPRE also utilizes parallel computing resources based in OpenMP to improve processing efficiency. The output is then linked to other tools and applications to understand the uncertainty in the measurements or new ways to apply the data. A brief description of some future design updates of the code will also be provided. As a whole, the AOSPRE code follows LROSE as an example for open source software development but with the specific intent to provide support to the APAR program and future interaction with field campaign planning and operations. </p></details></div> </div> <div class=row> <div class=cell><b>10:40 AM</b></div> <div class=cell>Dazhong Xia</div> <div class=cell-content><p></p> <details class="abstract cell"> <summary>A small tool for medium data: browser-based data exploration and export done quick</summary> <p><strong>[<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1q97loYyuiP8v6jnm9-d90gk5jXxZE7C9/view?usp=drive_link">Slides</a>] - [<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV1tyzzr0Ho&t=9771s">Recording</a>]</strong></p> <p><em>Dazhong is a member of Catalyst Cooperative, a worker-owned cooperative that wrangles data about the US energy system.

This means even relatively small teams can end up managing many different models applied to a diverse set of problems.

The Spack project has features which make software development in this complex environment simpler and more efficient. However, Spack comes with its own set of complexities and mechanisms which can deter new users from truly embracing the project. Fortunately some of these complexities can be simplified through extensions to Spack, as well as through the experience of using Spack in one's own project.</p> <p>In this short tutorial we will focus on demonstrating how to effectively use the software development features of Spack. We will also demonstrate how to add capability on top of Spack using extensions to automate configuration of machines used within a software project. We will show how this same development framework can be used for automating software testing and deployment. Participants will unravel how to turn Spack into the most convenient and extensible software development framework for high performance computing applications that exists today. </p></details></div> </div> <div class=row> <div class=cell><b>3:00 PM</b></div> <div class=cell></div> <div class=cell-content><p></p> <details class="info cell"> <summary>Networking Event</summary> <p></p></details></div> </div> <div class=row> <div class=cell><b>5:00 PM</b></div> <div class=cell></div> <div class=cell-content><p></p> <details class="warning cell"> <summary>End of Day 3</summary> <p></p></details></div> </div><p></p> </div> </div> <div class=tabbed-block> <p></p><div class=table> <div class=row> <div class=cell><b>8:30 AM</b></div> <div class=cell></div> <div class=cell-content><p></p> <details class="info cell"> <summary>Closing Remarks</summary> <p></p></details></div> </div> <div class=row> <div class=cell><b>8:40 AM</b></div> <div class=cell>Ligia Bernardet</div> <div class=cell-content><p></p> <details class="abstract cell"> <summary>Invited Keynote: Earth System Model Development Activities at the NOAA Global Systems Laboratory - A software engineering perspective</summary> <p><strong>[<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ts5m5w5TF3LsBb7hNFUTVaUWAaM5epsV/view?usp=drive_link">Slides</a>] - [<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdpMXYFufBs&t=2281s">Recording</a>]</strong></p> <p><em>Ligia Bernardet is a meteorologist with a PhD in atmospheric sciences from Colorado State University.

Physical models use diverse infrastructures, such as the Unified Forecast System (UFS), the Weather Research and Forecast (WRF) model, and the Model for Prediction Across Scales (MPAS). All models are evaluated for computational and scientific performance and must produce actionable information for users and stakeholders. Excellence in development relies on best practices in software engineering, such as component modularity with clear interfaces and sound code management with robust testing. The need for best practices is heightened by the distributed nature of our development, which includes partners from other NOAA entities, NCAR, and the broader community. This talk will describe the model development activities at NOAA GSL and provide highlights of selected efforts, including the management of physical parameterizations using the Common Community Physics Package (CCPP), the orchestration of scientific workflows with the Unified Workflow Tools package, and the training of machine learning models for weather prediction. </p></details></div> </div> <div class=row> <div class=cell><b>9:50 AM</b></div> <div class=cell></div> <div class=cell-content><p></p> <details class="info cell"> <summary>Break</summary> <p></p></details></div> </div> <div class=row> <div class=cell><b>10:20 AM</b></div> <div class=cell>Dom Heinzeller</div> <div class=cell-content><p></p> <details class="abstract cell"> <summary>The role of spack-stack in the operational implementation of the NAVY's next-generation weather forecasting model</summary> <p><strong>[<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IT6SzLXl5ppcwZhGRtZ5fMD1_LLUFX5A/view?usp=drive_link">Slides</a>] - [<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdpMXYFufBs&t=8415s">Recording</a>]</strong></p> <p><em>Dom Heinzeller graduated from Heidelberg University, Germany, with a PhD in Theoretical Astrophysics.

The transitioning of innovations from research to operations (R2O) and the feedback from operations to research (O2R) is one of the major challenges in the NWP world, to the extent that it is sometimes referred to as the "valley of death". One of the contributors to this challenge is that the environment in which the NWP systems operate can differ greatly. The development and testing often take place on different high-performance computing (HPC) systems, with varying environments of software (also referred to as software stacks), and with different workflows than in operations.</p> <p>For the first operational implementation of NEPTUNE in 2025, NRL and FNMOC are adopting a novel approach to address some of these challenges: First, FNMOC will be running on highly secured, fenced-off partitions on the same HPC systems that NRL uses for its development. Second, NRL will provide a software environment based on spack-stack. The spack-stack project is a joint effort of several major federal agencies and UCAR labs. It leverages the spack package manager developed by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and supported by a large community. Spack-stack utilizes modern software development practices like continuous integration (CI) and a fast release cycle. Through the use of spack source mirrors and binary caches, FNMOC will be able to deploy bit-for-bit identical software environments in their secured environments in a matter of minutes.</p> <p>In this presentation, we will revisit the challenges in the R2O2R cycle in NWP, provide an overview of the joint spack-stack effort, and cover the deployment of NEPTUNE in operations.</p> <p>[Distribution Statement Approved for public release.

These products can be satellite imagery, radar plots, weather balloon SkewTs, field reports, etc. In most cases, these products for a given field project’s field catalog are all generated by the EOL catalog admins staff by either pulling products from the web or producing plots from scientific data.</p> <p>The field catalog was developed back in 1995, and there have been two official UI versions of the field catalog released in 1995 and 2013, but there haven’t been many major updates to the code that generates the products that are displayed in the field catalog. These products were mostly generated using perl code that was copied with minor changes unique to each field campaign. For the last 30 years, this perl code has served the EOL catalog team very well, but there was a desire to modernize this code using object oriented principles in Python. Thus, after working directly with an EOL Software Engineering mentor, a new GitHub repository of Python code was developed. Within the new Python code, an FCProduct class was defined, issues were tracked, branches were created, and the importance of exception handling was learned. The journey of creating this new object oriented python code for field catalog product generation highlights the importance of continuing to modernize our code at NSF NCAR and provides the capability to create more unique and complex products for the EOL Field Catalog into the future. </p></details></div> </div> <div class=row> <div class=cell><b>11:00 AM</b></div> <div class=cell>Daniel Madren</div> <div class=cell-content><p></p> <details class="abstract cell"> <summary>From Chaos to Clarity: Structuring Research Software Engineering Projects for Success</summary> <p><strong>[<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FhgH2dK8oTUA7Qd8vVQ_IAAOYAf08ebL/view?usp=drive_link">Slides</a>] - [<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdpMXYFufBs&t=10856s">Recording</a>]</strong></p> <p><em>Daniel joined the Purdue Research Computing team in April 2024 as the Program Manager for the newly established RSE Center.

Although these ideas are promising, they often assume a large team that includes individuals who have the required expertise.</p> <p>Our proposed practical framework instead targets a small team of domain experts, with the only requirement being that someone be found (either from the original team, or externally added) who is interested in deepening their software knowledge by volunteering for the developer role. Our framework, especially for the beginning stage of requirements elicitation, includes step-by-step guidance. The process begins with questions the developer asks the domain expert(s). These questions cover topics such as the expected inputs and outputs, the computational scale of the problem and special input cases with known solutions or trends. The methodology shows how to map the answers to these questions to the requirements, high-level design and verification documentation. Templates for all documentation, in markdown format, are provided in a GitHub template, along with the initial infrastructure for issue tracking and continuous deployment of the project's webpage. The proposed methodology incorporates four main pieces of advice: i) the notation and structure for documenting the theory should be selected to facilitate the transition to design and implementation; ii) continuous integration should be part of the project from the start; iii) the low-level design documentation should be done through structured comments in the code, like docstrings or doxygen; and, iv) the modular decomposition needs to consider the computational scale when balancing information hiding and performance. </p> <p>Our talk will present the details of the framework, examples of its application and initial plans for experiments to assess its effectiveness. </p></details></div> </div> <div class=row> <div class=cell><b>11:40 AM</b></div> <div class=cell>Maria Patrou</div> <div class=cell-content><p></p> <details class="abstract cell"> <summary>Modernization and Standardization of Software tools in Spectroscopy</summary> <p><strong>[<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jnGY6dvzRj0LAqjLEU5bYOSP0ltTEVUp/view?usp=drive_link">Slides</a>] - [<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdpMXYFufBs&t=13565s">Recording</a>]</strong></p> <p>**Coauthors: Kyle Ma, Andrei Savici*</p> <p><em>Dr. Maria Patrou joined Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) in 2023.

Many existing ESMs are based on legacy codes dating back decades. These codes often require hundreds to thousands of CPUs to run, predate modern software design principles, and are typically manually tuned with a fraction of the Earth observations currently available. The Climate Modeling Alliance (CliMA) is developing an open source ESM from scratch, with the intention of providing the wider community with access to a model that leverages modern computing capabilities, including cloud GPUs, and enables rapidly iterated learning from the wealth of Earth observations now available.</p> <p>This talk will provide an overview of the CliMA model and software ecosystem. It focuses on the project’s software infrastructure and integrated pipeline for automated calibration and uncertainty quantification of model components with data. As the ESM itself is computationally intensive to run, the calibration also becomes very expensive, even when leveraging GPU resources. To address this problem, we have developed methods to use ML-based emulators to accelerate model calibration and uncertainty quantification, which we are able to use within an iterative cycle during the model development process. </p></details></div> </div> <div class=row> <div class=cell><b>1:40 PM</b></div> <div class=cell>Erik Kluzek</div> <div class=cell-content><p></p> <details class="abstract cell"> <summary>Helping Scientists Embrace their Inner Research Software Engineer (RSE) and Working Together with the Community Earth System Model (CESM) RSE's to improve CESM Science; From a Land Component Model (CTSM) Perspective</summary> <p><strong>[<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tWercFlWkF6DgL7iktaEUVTgDLegzeii/view?usp=drive_link">Slides</a>] - [<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdpMXYFufBs&t=20391s">Recording</a>]</strong></p> <p><em>Erik Kluzek has been working as a Research Software Engineer for four decades.

There is a list of challenges that CESM RSE’s have with both bringing in new science for CESM and ensuring CESM is well tested, robust, flexible as well as having the correct science. As such CESM Scientists working in CESM code need to work alongside CESM RSE’s to adopt RSE practices while their science is being developed. For CESM to be useful for scientists it needs to be: well-tested, robust, reproducible, flexible and have assurance that the science is implemented correctly. This is needed both for the science and the software of CESM.
